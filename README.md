<h1> Exploring Microsoft Entra ID </h1>

<h2> What I learned: </h2>

While Active Directory and Entra ID are essentially the same in that they both manage permissions, authentication, and more, each has its use case. If youd like a service with auto management & minimal configuration on your part, Entra ID is your best bet. If youd like more control and less expenses, Active Directory is the right choice.
